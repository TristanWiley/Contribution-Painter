##Paint your Github Contribution panel pretty colors!

Paint your (or someone else's) Chrome contribution panel! Make it pretty colors, make a meme, make it say something. You have 5 colors to choose from.

To use press hold down shift and press the blocks in the color pane, you can change colors by clicking the extension's icon.

(Super tired writing this).
